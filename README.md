# Microplastics-Health-Risk-Estimator
The Microplastics Health Risk Estimator uses machine learning to predict health risk from simulated microplastic exposure data. It classifies risk as low, medium, or high, and provides visual insights for reducing exposure, serving as a foundation for future real-world data integration in environmental health research.
